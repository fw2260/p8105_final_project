## Proposal

Video games are becoming increasingly popular and mainstream, a favorite pastime across a wide demographic with something out there for everyone. As video game and data enthusiasts, we think it would be interesting to explore the various aspects of the most critically-acclaimed games according to Metacritic, a critic and user review aggregate site, and their relationship to actual sales numbers.

Our first data source for review scores and general information will come from https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered?view=detailed&page=0. We will be scraping information such as game title, platform, genre, release date, developer, ESRB rating, Metascore, and user score.

Our second data source for actual sales numbers will come from https://www.vgchartz.com/games/games.php. We will be scraping information such as units shipped and revenue by geographical region.

We are interested in the following analyses:

1. User score vs. Metascore
2. Total sales by genre over time
3. Which time period generated the most popular games?
4. Which developer released the most/least popular games or the highest/lowest scored?
5. Preference of users of different platform
6. Preference of users from different regions
7. What factors influence sales? How do they influence it?

Most, if not all, data will be visualized in the form of interactive graphs on a dashboard. Anticipated coding challenges will be scraping, cleaning, and combining the data from the two websites because of possible discrepancies in naming conventions as well as not all information being on a single webpage.
