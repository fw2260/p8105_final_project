## Proposal

Video games are becoming increasingly popular and mainstream, a favorite
pastime across a wide demographic with something out there for everyone.
As video game and data enthusiasts, we think it would be interesting to
explore the various aspects of the most critically-acclaimed games
according to Metacritic, a critic and user review aggregate site, and
their relationship to actual sales numbers.

Our first data source for review scores and general information will
come from
[metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered?view=detailed&page=0).
We will be scraping information such as game title, platform, genre,
release date, developer, ESRB rating, Metascore, and user score.

Our second data source for actual sales numbers will come from
[vgchartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/games/games.php). We will be
scraping information such as units shipped and revenue by geographical
region.

We are interested in the following analyses:

1.  User score vs. Metascore
2.  Total sales by genre over time
3.  Which time period generated the most popular games?
4.  Which developers released the most/least popular games or the
    highest/lowest scored?
5.  Preference of users of different platform
6.  Preference of users from different regions
7.  What factors influence sales? How do they influence it?

Most, if not all, data will be visualized in the form of interactive
graphs on a dashboard. In the end, we want a series of dashboards that
provides insights on the aforementioned topics and conveys our findings
clearly to the audience.

Anticipated coding challenges will be scraping, cleaning, and combining
the data from the two websites because of possible discrepancies in
naming conventions as well as not all information being on a single
webpage.
